컴퓨터 애니메이션 과제3  

- Requirements and Keyboard input  
  - Basic operations  
  > 1. Create particles (c key)  
  > 2. Attach particles (a key)  
  > 3. Select nail particles (n key)  
  > 4. Drag a particle while simulating the system (d key)  
  - Damping of a mass-spring system in which a single particle is nailed  
  > 5. Turn on/off point damping (p key)  
  > 6. Turn on/off damped spring (s key)  
  - System instability
  > 7. Make the system instable by increasing the spring constant (up key & e key)
  > 8. Stabilize the system by decreasing the time step size or sub-time step size (1~9 key & m key)
  - Free falling
  > 9. Remove all nail constraints so that the particles bounce on the floor and walls (r key)
- Select : Find the closest point/edge from a given point and select that point/edge
